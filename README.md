# An Introduction to Statistical Learning Notes

Notes for the Python version of the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python". https://www.statlearning.com/

I read this book a couple of years back, I found the notes so I just decided to share them here for anyone who might find them useful.
